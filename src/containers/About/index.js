          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ my name is <span>Joseph Salen</span>, I'm a React.js
          Front-end Developer currently living in Venezuela. For the last two
          years I've been learning how to create beautiful and powerful websites
          to bring the life of awesome products to the Internet. My goal is to
          translate your idea into a Website that not only looks pretty but also
          become easy to use for your user.

          something related to frontend or backend development, but my specialty
          is Front-End Development.
